        <p className="font-medium mb-1">Information You Provide to Us:</p>
        <p>We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request on-demand services, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may include name, email, phone number, postal address, profile picture, payment method, items requested (for delivery services), delivery notes, and other information you choose to provide.</p>
        <p>Information We Collect Through Your Use of Our Services: When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following general categories:</p>
        <p>* Location Information: When you use the Services for transportation or delivery, we collect precise location data about the trip from the Wynk app used by the Driver and/or Patron. If you permit the Wynk app to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system (“platform”), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.</p>
        <p>* Contacts Information: If you permit the Wynk app to access the address book on your device through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services and for other purposes described in this Statement or at the time of consent or collection.</p>
        <p>* Transaction Information: We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your promo code, we may associate your name with that person.</p>
        <p>* Usage and Preference Information: We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. To learn more about these technologies, please see our Cookie Statement.</p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Important Information about Platform Permissions:</h3>
        <p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the Wynk app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Wynk app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent. To learn about the platform-level permissions that the app seeks, please visit our new iOS Permissions page and Android Permissions page. Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves provide, and the permissions we request will change over time, so we've created these pages to serve as authoritative and up-to-date resources for our users.</p>
